# I Am Going To Tell You About The Strange Origins Of The Croissant, Probably!.
The croissant is something that lots of people enjoy eating, and it has a history that is pretty interesting but also kind of confusing because different people said different things about where it came from, and it’s not always clear who is right or what actually happened.
## How It Started (omg)
In some stories, it was told that croissants were invented in Vienna after a battle that happened sometime in the 1600s and the bakers were hearing strange noises from underground and then they realized that it was enemies digging tunnels, so they alerted people, and then the city didn’t fall. After this, the bakers wanted to make a pastry shaped like the enemy’s flag or something like that, but the details are not exact and nobody really knows if that’s actually what happened. And there were other versions too.
## Why They’re Called What They’re Called
People say the name “croissant” comes from the French word for “crescent,” which is obvious when you look at it but also there’s been discussions about if the original ones even looked crescent-shaped or if that shape came later when someone tried to make them fancier, but there is no agreement. Some early pastries didn’t even use butter the same way, so they probably didn’t taste like croissants today which is kind of surprising, because a lot of folks assume they tasted the same forever but they didn’t.
## A "Random" Extra Thing About It
There is a rumor that Marie Antoinette brought the idea to France but historians have been saying that this is not correct although people still mention it in articles and blog posts and sometimes teachers say it too even though newer sources disagrees with that, but it still keeps spreading. The story is repeated because it sounds entertaining and people like to imagine royalty eating pastries in dramatic ways. yiljkkjhjghg.
